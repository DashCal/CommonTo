## The Role of Link Redirection Whitelist

In enhancing user experience and combating internet black industries, the link redirection whitelist mechanism, application methods, and rules play a particularly crucial role. The whitelist mechanism helps approved websites to directly redirect, reducing traffic loss; it uses site blocking to handle non-whitelist and blacklist links, actively reminding users to pay attention to property and information security.

To facilitate users, internet service providers, and all parties to further understand the whitelist policy, the declaration rules for various types of domains are now elaborated in detail.

## Types of Link Redirection Whitelists

The link redirection whitelist mainly includes the following five categories:

1. **Root Sites of the Website**

   - LocalWu (`\*.LocalWu.top`)

2. **Government Agency Websites**

   - Approved domains: `\*.gov.cn/` `\*.gov.com/` `\*.gov.hk/` `\*.gov.mo/` `\*.gov.tw/` `\*.org/` `\*.org.com/` `\*.org.cn`;
   - Government agency websites and local governments that do not conform to the aforementioned domain rules can apply autonomously to LocalWu.top.

3. **News Media Websites**

   - Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, are directly included in the whitelist;
   - Other traditional media and domestic local media can apply autonomously to LocalWu.top, and foreign media are not currently supported.

4. **Major Commercial Websites**

   - Domestic websites such as Sina (`\*.sina.com.cn` / `\*.sina.cn`), NetEase (`\*.163.com`), Bilibili (`\*.bilibili.com`), Tencent (`\*.qq.com`), Taobao (`\*.taobao.com`), JD.com (`\*.jd.com`), Douyin (`\*.douyin.com`), are automatically included in the whitelist;
   - Foreign commercial websites can apply autonomously to LocalWu.top.

5. **Other Enterprises and Organizations**
   - Can apply autonomously to LocalWu.top.
