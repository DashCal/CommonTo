            <p>to.LocalWu.top (JumpTo) is the link forwarding provider.<br>
                  For simplicity, we will use "LocalWu.top" hereinafter abbreviated as the term for "to.LocalWu.top
                  (JumpTo)".</p>
            <h2 id="the-role-of-link-redirection-allowlist">The Role of Link Redirection Allowlist </h2>
            <p>In enhancing user experience and combating internet black industries, the link redirection allowlist
                  mechanism, application methods, and rules play a particularly crucial role. The allowlist mechanism
                  helps approved websites to directly redirect, reducing traffic loss; it uses site blocking to handle
                  non-allowlist and blocklist links, actively reminding users to pay attention to property and
                  information security.</p>
            <p>To facilitate users, internet service providers, and all parties to further understand the allowlist
                  policy, the declaration rules for various types of domains are now elaborated in detail.</p>
            <h2 id="types-of-link-redirection-allowlists">Types of Link Redirection Allowlists </h2>
            <p>The link redirection allowlist mainly includes the following five categories:</p>
            <ol>
                  <li>
                        <p><strong>Root Sites of the Website</strong></p>
